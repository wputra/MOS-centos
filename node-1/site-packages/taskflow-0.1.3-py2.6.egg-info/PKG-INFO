Description: TaskFlow
        ========
        
        A library to do [jobs, tasks, flows] in a HA manner using different backends to
        be used with OpenStack projects.

        Testing and requirements
        ------------------------
        
        ### Requirements
        
        Because TaskFlow has many optional (pluggable) parts like persistence
        backends and engines, we decided to split our requirements into two
        parts:
        - things that are absolutely required by TaskFlow (you can't use
          TaskFlow without them) are put to `requirements.txt`;
        - things that are required by some optional part of TaskFlow (you
          can use TaskFlow without them) are put to `optional-requirements.txt`;
          if you want to use the feature in question, you should add that
          requirements to your project or environment;
        - as usual, things that required only for running tests are put
          to `test-requirements.txt`.
        
        ### Tox.ini
        
        Our tox.ini describes several test environments that allow to test
        TaskFlow with different python versions and sets of requirements
        installed.
        
        To generate tox.ini, use the `toxgen.py` script by first installing
        [toxgen](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toxgen/) and then provide that script
        as input the `tox-tmpl.ini` file to generate the final `tox.ini` file.
        
        *For example:*
        
            $ toxgen.py -i tox-tmpl.ini -o tox.ini
