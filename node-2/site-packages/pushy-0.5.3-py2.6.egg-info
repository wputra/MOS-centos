Description: Pushy is a Python library for allowing one to connect to a remote Python
        interpreter, and transparently access objects in that interpreter as if they
        were objects within the local interpreter.
        
        Pushy has the novel ability to execute a remote Python interpreter and start a
        request servicing loop therein, without requiring any custom Python libraries
        (including Pushy) to be initially present. To accomplish this, Pushy requires
        an SSH daemon to be present on the remote machine.
        
        Pushy was initially developed to simplify automated testing to the point that
        testing software on remote machines becomes little different to testing on the
        local machine.
