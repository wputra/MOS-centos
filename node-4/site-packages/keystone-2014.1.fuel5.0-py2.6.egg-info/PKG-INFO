Description: ==================
        OpenStack Keystone
        ==================
        
        Keystone provides authentication, authorization and service discovery
        mechanisms via HTTP primarily for use by projects in the OpenStack family. It
        is most commonly deployed as an HTTP interface to existing identity systems,
        such as LDAP.
