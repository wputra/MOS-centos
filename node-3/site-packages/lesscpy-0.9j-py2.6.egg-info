Description: LESSCPY
        =======
        
        Python LESS Compiler.
        
        A compiler written in Python for the LESS language. For those of us not willing
        or able to have node.js installed in our environment. Not all features of LESS
        are supported (yet). Some features wil probably never be supported (JavaScript
        evaluation). This program uses PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) to tokenize / parse the
        input and is considerably slower than the NodeJS compiler. The plan is to
        utilize this to build in proper syntax checking and perhaps YUI compressing.
        
        This is an early version, so you are likly to find bugs.
